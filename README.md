A number of people/projects/companies we've talked to would like to show support for some changes to the CVE and CNA processes and tooling. We decided an open letter showing the people who support this would be helpful to illustrate the strength of it.

If you would like to do this and support this letter please open a pull request adding your signature.

The dash formatting is there to try and minimise merge conflicts.
